						Believe it or not—we will never need to rebalance storage in its classic form. Due to hybrid
						rebalancing, we never reach the point where we need to reallocate 50% of one asset to another.
					</p>
					<p>
						As for volatility—we’re going to use classic indicators such as Keltner Channels and/or
						Bollinger Bands, but the difference is that our model, which we’ve already back-tested, works
						wonders!
